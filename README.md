Repo I am using to do analysis on best bang for your buck for apartments in Japan. Will write about this more etc. 


### To Do:
- make scraping script loop through so that I can pull multiple datasets at once - since scraping part is basically a function this is taken care of mostly - will still need to build the loop.. 
- get navitime portion of code to work - still need pull down long, lat, time to work, time to work by bike, number of train transfers 
- work on models R/python
- kubernetes portion of it - pretty much done with this part. Just need to make images availabe to k8s cluster 
- set up to [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) to run it all 
- expose model(s) as api 
- anything else? 
- fix money representations within dataset
